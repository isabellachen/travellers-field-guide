# Setting up WordPress for this theme

## Random Home Hero Images

To get the random image for the home hero, you have to create a field group (e.g. "Single Post Custom Fields").
The field Name should be called home_hero, field type True/False.

## Set up featured stories

### For Home Page

### For Country Page

## Category Pages

The theme utilises custom images for category pages, e.g. destinations/europe/iceland
To set up the custom images, we need to add an [ACF for an image in the category page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-taxonomy-term/).

Set up ACF for home_hero to generate random home page hero images
