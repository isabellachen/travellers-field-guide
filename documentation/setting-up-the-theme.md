# Setting up WordPress for this theme

## Set up the Home Page and FrontPage Template Pages

### Leading title

- To display 'Who We Are', you need to add 'Who We Are' to the excerpt field of the Home Page.

### Random Home Hero Images (ACF setup)

- To get the random image for the home hero, you have to create a field group with ACF (e.g. "Single Post Custom Fields").
  The field Name should be called home_hero, Field Type > Choice > True/False.

### Featured Stories for Home Page (ACF setup)

- The theme displays the three latest featured stories on the Home Page. To set up, under the field group "Single Post Custom Fields" create a field called home_featured, Field Type > Choice > True/False.

- To set up the portrait image of the featured story, create a custom field "featured_story_image", of Field Type Image. Make sure the return format is "Image Array".

### Featured Stories of Page (ACF setup)

- The theme displays the three latest featured stories on each page using the Frontpage template. To set up, under the field group "Single Post Custom Fields" create a field called page_featured, Field Type > Choice > True/False.

## Set up the Pages using 'Frontpage Template' (e.g. 'Kenya', 'Blog', 'Music Videos')

- Make sure the post has the correct tag. The tag needs to have the same slug as the page.
  E.g. the page slug for 'Cape Verde' is 'cape-verde'. The slug for the tag 'Cape Verde' is also 'cape-verde'.
- In the Edit Page Sidebar > Document > Page Attributes > Template: Frontpage Template (uses page_frontpage.php)
- The code relies on the title to display "Featured stories from <THE_TITLE>".
- Don't forget to add the portrait style "Featured Story Image", although the theme falls back onto the featured image.
- Don't forget to add an excerpt so we have a leading title (e.g. Land of the Lion King)
- To select the featured stories, check the 'page_featured' field in the post.

### What if there are not enough posts?

- FrontPage template only displays the square tiles section if there are more than three posts with the matching tag.
- If there are less than three posts, you need to select 'page_featured' for the one, two or three posts that match the tag. If no featured posts are selected, and there are less than three posts matching the page, no posts will be displayed.

## Image Sizes

In total, this theme needs 5 different image sizes.

You need to configure 3 of these in Settings > Media

- Thumbnail: 150 \* 150 (default)
- Medium Size: 0
- Large Size: 1024 \* 1024 (pre-existing default)

The other two sizes are created automatically.

- 540px is created by the theme (found in functions.php) 'Width-S 540'
- 769px is an autogenerated WordPress dimension 'Medium Large'

Hero images need to be uploaded at 2880 x 1800

## Category Pages

The theme utilises custom images for category pages, e.g. destinations/europe/iceland
To set up the custom images, we need to add an [ACF for an image in the category page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-taxonomy-term/).

Set up ACF for home_hero to generate random home page hero images

## Flex Column Shortcodes

- The theme uses the custom plugin "Columned Images for Madhouse Heaven". Remember to upload the latest version.
- Usage: [flex_col_images num_col=3][/flex_col_images]
- Takes three or four columns
