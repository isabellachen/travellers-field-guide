# Setting up WordPress for this theme

## Set up the Home Page

### Leading title

To display 'Who We Are', you need to add 'Who We Are' to the excerpt field of the Home Page.

### Random Home Hero Images

To get the random image for the home hero, you have to create a field group (e.g. "Single Post Custom Fields").
The field Name should be called home_hero, Field Type > Choice > True/False.

## Set Up Featured Stories

The theme displays the three latest featured stories on the Home Page. To set up, under the field group for Single Posts,
(e.g. "Single Post Custom Fields") create a field called home_featured, Field Type > Choice > True/False.

To set up the portrait image of the featured story, create a custom field "featured_story_image", of Field Type Image. Make sure the return format is "Image Array".

## Set Up Country Stories

The theme displays the three latest featured stories of the country on the country page. Set up is similar to Featured Stories for the Home Page. The naming is "country_featured" for the boolean field. This feature uses the "featured_story_image" to display the portait image in the country page.

## Image Sizes

In total, this theme needs 5 different image sizes.

You need to configure 3 of these in Settings > Media

- Thumbnail: 150 \* 150 (default)
- Medium Size: 0
- Large Size: 1024 \* 1024 (pre-existing default)

The other two sizes are created automatically.

- 540px is created by the theme (found in functions.php) 'Width-S 540'
- 769px is an autogenerated WordPress dimension 'Medium Large'

Hero images need to be uploaded at 2880 x 1800

## Country Pages

- Each destination needs to have a page created for it. E.g. "Kenya" or "Iceland".
- The code relies on the title to display "Featured stories from <THE_TITLE>".
- It also uses the title to find posts of the same country.
- In the Edit Page Sidebar > Document > Page Attributes > Template: Frontpage Template (uses page_frontpage.php)
- Make sure to select "Country Featured"
- Don't forget to add the portrait style "Featured Story Image", although the theme falls back onto the featured image.
- Don't forget to add an excerpt so we have a leading title (e.g. Land of the Lion King)

## Category Pages

The theme utilises custom images for category pages, e.g. destinations/europe/iceland
To set up the custom images, we need to add an [ACF for an image in the category page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-taxonomy-term/).

Set up ACF for home_hero to generate random home page hero images

## Flex Column Shortcodes

The theme uses the custom plugin "Columned Images for Madhouse Heaven". Remember to upload the latest version.
