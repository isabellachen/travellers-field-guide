# Updating Image Sizes

Wordpress generates too many unnecessary image sizes. I have a new theme which utilises the following sizes.

- 150 width and height for thumnails (thumbnail media settings)
- 540 width for long portraits (custom size set in theme)
- 800 width (medium media settings)
- 1170 width (large media settings)
- 2545 (hero image crop, done manually with photoshop)

The current wordpress defaults are

- 150 (thumbnail)
- 300 (medium, media settings)
- 768 (generated, used for mobile)
- 1024 (large, media settings)
- 1536 (generated)
- 2048 (generated)
- 2560 (generated)

The smartblog theme generates

- 60 x 60 (theme: 'post-widget-thumb')

- 100 x 100 (theme: 'blog-related')
- 150 x 150 (media settings: thumbnail)

- 300 x 300 (media settings: medium)
- 342 x 225 (theme: featured-other)
- 600 x 525 (theme: featured carousel)
- 748 x 350 (theme: page-featured)
- 768 x 748 (autogenerated: medium large)
- 800 X 450 (featured-first)
- 1024 (media settings: large)
- 1140 (theme: featured-full image)

## Fixing up the images

Reset default sizes in Settings > Media

- 300  → 800
- 1024  → 1170
